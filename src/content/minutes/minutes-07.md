## Project Overview

SmartHome Access revolutionizes home automation by making it truly accessible for people with mobility impairments. The system combines voice control, eye tracking, and adaptive switches to provide multiple ways of controlling home environments, from lighting and temperature to doors and appliances.

## Technical Challenges

The biggest hurdle was creating a reliable multi-modal control system that could adapt to different types of mobility impairments. We developed a flexible control interface that can be customized to each user's capabilities, from eye tracking to sip-and-puff controls, while maintaining responsive and reliable operation.

## Testimonial
